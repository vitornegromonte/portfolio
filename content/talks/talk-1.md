# Parkinson Diagnosis using Computer Vision

Explored the current state and future directions of AI in Parkinson Diagnosis.

This talk presented our research on using computer vision techniques to diagnose Parkinson's disease through the analysis of spiral drawings. The presentation covered:

- Our CNN-based approach for detecting Parkinson's disease at various stages
- Dataset creation and preprocessing techniques
- Model architecture and training methodology
- Results and performance metrics
- Future directions for research in this area

The talk was well-received and sparked interesting discussions about the potential applications of AI in healthcare diagnostics.
