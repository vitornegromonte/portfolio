Undergraduate Information Systems student at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), focused on data science and machine learning. Served as a teaching assistant for Computational Creativity and Introduction to Deep Learning.

During my sophomore year, I joined the Brazilian National Institute of Software Engineering as a Research Assistant in the Smart Cities and IoT Group, advised by Kiev Gama, Ana Paula Chaves (NAU), and Danilo Ribeiro (Cesar School). I co-authored papers accepted at IHC 2024 and SBSI 2025.

At the end of that year, I joined the Geraia group, where I research Generative AI — evaluating large language models in Portuguese and other emerging languages. I'm also interested in energy-efficient generative models, with a focus on low-resource deployment scenarios.

I co-founded Ligia — UFPE's Artificial Intelligence League, a nonprofit initiative dedicated to AI research, competitions, and education. As Outreach Director, I lead strategic partnerships, organize AI-centered events, and develop educational materials to promote AI understanding and application across disciplines.

I also co-founded the AI startup redduo.ai, where I briefly served as Chief Data Officer and co-Chief Technology Officer.

Outside academics, I enjoy photography, reading, sports, and creative coding.
