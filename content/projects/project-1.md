# MARS: Multi Agent Recommendation System

This project implements a sophisticated paper recommendation system that leverages multiple AI agents to filter and recommend research papers from ArXiv based on user interests. The system combines vector embeddings with LLM-based agents to provide highly relevant paper recommendations.

## Features

- Automated paper collection from ArXiv
- Multi-agent filtering system
- Email notifications with recommended papers
- Customizable research interests
- FastAPI-based RESTful API

## Technologies Used

- FastAPI
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Vector embeddings
- Python
