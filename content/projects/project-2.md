detailedDescription: "Developed a CNN-based approach for detecting Parkinson's disease at various stages using images of spirals drawn on paper. Our model outperformed state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset by approximately 10%, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy. The approach uses a custom CNN architecture optimized for detecting subtle variations in hand-drawn spirals."
